# DeepLearning_ExtremeImageDenoising

Implementation of image denoising with autoencoders for the final project of the subject Deep Learning (UPF). 

We used the mnsit dataset by, first adding random noise to the data and, with the use of autoencoders, create new data that would resemble the original as much as possible. We also tried with an image of Einstein, but were not able to do so.
